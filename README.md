# TCGP - Trading Card Game Platform

## Overview

**TCGP** is an interactive card database and e-commerce-style web application designed for TCGP game fans. Users can explore all cards from the latest version, filter by rarity, card packs, or series, and build their dream collection using a virtual budget.

This project was created out of love for the game and as a way to explore building a more engaging e-commerce-like experience compared to traditional fake-data stores.
